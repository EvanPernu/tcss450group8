A: Features implemented:
1. We use our proprietary web service to send user preferences to the server. After registration a new user will be
 prompted to provide their opinions on 10 different categories. Those opinions are then stored in our database.

2. We have a login/register system that ensures the user's passwords match and are at least 8 characters long. 

3. We use our external api (Eventbrite) to search for events by keywords. It returns the list of events found as a list.


B: Use cases implemented: 
1. We implemented use case 3 from our proposal. We changed the way we implemented this from our proposal, however. 
Instead of adjusting a slider to search for events within X miles of you, we implemented it so that you type in
the location of the event you are searching for. 

2. We implemented use case 1 from our proposal, you can search for upcoming events.
